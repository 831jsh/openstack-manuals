Content specification
=====================

Blueprints and specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Documentation team uses specifications in the `docs-specs repository
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/docs-specs>`_ to maintain large
changes. Approved specifications are published at `Documentation Program
Specifications <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/docs-specs>`_.
For tracking purposes, a blueprint is created for each specification. It is
also good practice to contact the project team or subteam for the book you want
to change to discuss your changes before starting work.

Use blueprints and specifications:

* When adding large sections to an existing document to ensure involvement
  of the docs core team.
* When adding an entirely new deliverable to the docs project.
* For any work that requires both content and tooling changes, such as
  addition of the API reference site.
* For any large reorganization of a deliverable or set of deliverables.
* For automation work that needs to be designed prior to proposing a patch.
* For work that should definitely be discussed at a summit.

A specification needs two +2 votes from the docs-specs-core team.
See the current list of `docs-specs core team
<https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/384,members>`_.

Use bugs against openstack-manuals or openstack-api-site:

* For known content issues, even if you have to do multiple patches to close
  the bug.
* To add content that is just missing.
* For known errors in a document.

For more information, see :ref:`doc_bugs`.

Release-specific documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release-specific documentation is published continuously as changes are
made, with different versions for each series.

To patch release-specific documentation, submit your
patch to the master branch with "backport: xxxx" (for example, backport:
kilo) in the commit message. During Pike, much of the material
maintained by the documentation team was moved into project team
repositories, so patching the same content for different release
series may mean looking for the relevant files in multiple places.

.. note::

   The following guides were release specific before the Pike
   migration:

   * Configuration reference
   * Command-line reference
   * Installation guides
   * Networking guide

For these guides, the docs.openstack.org site defaults to the current release,
with the previous two releases being available under the ``More Releases
& Languages`` drop-down. At release time, the documentation release team
will update the default page to the new release, and remove the link to
the oldest release. These docs are still available online for people who
have direct URLs to the content, but they are no longer linked from the
main site. For books written in DocBook XML, these old versions are clearly
marked with the release name in red down the left-hand margin. We are
currently developing a similar method of marking older books written in RST.
The core team tracks usage of older versions, and as usage falls, can
remove them entirely.

Installation Guides
-------------------

Starting with Pike, the OpenStack Installation Guides
are maintained by the project teams, with assistance from the
documentation team. The guides describe a manual install process for
multiple distributions based on openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server; Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS; and Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS).

Prior to Pike, the documentation team maintained OpenStack

Guides for deployers and administrators
---------------------------------------

As of Pike, the configuration reference and administration guide(s)
are maintained by each project team.

Prior to Pike, the documentation team maintained the following
combined guides:

* `OpenStack Configuration Reference
  <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/>`_:
  Contains a reference listing of all configuration options for OpenStack
  services by release version.
* `OpenStack Networking Guide
  <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/networking-guide/>`_:
  This guide targets OpenStack administrators seeking to deploy and manage
  OpenStack Networking (neutron).

Continuously released documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These guides cover multiple versions and follows the general
`release information <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Releases>`_.
The guides cover the latest two versions, for
example Juno and Kilo. The following exceptions apply:

* HA Guide: Updated last at Havana timeframe, still needs updates

Project-specific guides
-----------------------

Each project maintains its own guides for installation,
administration, configuration reference, and contributors.  They are
published from each project repository. See the
`OpenStack Projects <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-projects.html>`_ and
the `OpenStack API Bindings <https://docs.openstack.org/language-bindings.html>`_
pages for more information.

Each project's repo has a ``doc/source`` directory where RST source
files are stored. They are built automatically with Sphinx when the
patch is merged. For example, see
the ` horizon documentation source <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/horizon/tree/doc/source>`_
and the `built documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/>`_.

* `Infrastructure User Manual <https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual>`_:
  Reference documentation for tools and processes used for all
  contributors to OpenStack projects. It includes instructions on how
  to create all the necessary accounts, setup development environment,
  use gerrit review workflow. The manual also covers more
  advanced topics, like how to create new git repositories. The manual is
  maintained by the OpenStack Infrastructure team.
