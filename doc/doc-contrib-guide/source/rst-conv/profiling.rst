Installation Guides has content that depends upon the operating
systems.

Use separate files to specify content that is operating-system specific. Each
file should have the same name but for an addition suffix. The following
suffixes should be used:

* ``ubuntu`` for Ubuntu
* ``debian`` for Debian
* ``rdo`` for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS
* ``obs`` for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise

.. note::

  Previously, ``.. only`` directives were used to generate conditional output.
  This required multiple builds and has since been phased out.
